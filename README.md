If u want to add illegal items you have to edit config and server (top of server). 

Works with QB-core and ps-dispatch, must haves anyway so you probably are good to go. 

If you want to set up ps-dispatch make sure that u check alertdispatch file and add the dispatch to ps-dispatch > client > alerts > scroll to bottom and copy pasta voila.
